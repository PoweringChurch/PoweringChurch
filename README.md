## Hello! o/
I'm Xavier, a 15 year old student in Florida. I really like doing math and science, and especially find computational biology interesting. I want to combine my passion for programming and the advances in healthcare to do something with the time I have.

I have the most functional programming experience in C# and Lua, but I am also familiar with C++ and Python. I plan to brush up my C++ skills some more by practicing with some more libraries soon, and will likely have my projects up on my profile.

### Notable Work

#### Built a language model in Lua with no external libraries.

This project was a relatively small language model, and was created to understand transformer architecture fundamentals in practice. I chose Lua for this project as it was fast and simple, making the focus of the project be the concepts rather than the language itself. From this project, I learned the exact purpose of every step in how neural networks function, putting what I learned from various learning courses on machine learning into practice.

#### [Health Metrics API](https://github.com/PoweringChurch/HealthMetrics)

The Health Metrics API is a Minimal API that is designed to store and retrieve information about patients and relevant medical records. This project was created to get more experience in medical practices and what goes into making a web API. I'm currently working on this project!

#### Achievements so far

* Currently maintaining a 4.5 weighted GPA
* Knowledge Pillar's Wordpress Certified Editor certification  
* Certiport's Entrepreneurship and Small Business certification

## Goals

I aspire to get into applied computing in medicine and health, and am currently gathering experience in the relevant areas to make landing a job in the field easier.  
I believe that using my skills for medicinal purposes will help the most people, which is something I try to do as much as possible in my life.

As of right now, I want to finish my current HealthMetrics Minimal API project. After completing this project, I want to start work on another project to practice the fundamentals in diagnostics and algorithms.
